            Look at this photograph
            Every time I do, it makes me laugh
            How did our eyes get so red?
            And what the hell is on Joey's head?
            And this is where I grew up
            I think the present owner fixed it up
            I never knew we'd ever went without
            The second floor is hard for sneaking out
            And this is where I went to school
            Most of the time had better things to do
            Criminal record says I broke in twice
            I must have done it half a dozen times
            I wonder if it's too late
            Should I go back and try to graduate?
            Life's better now than it was back then
            If I was them, I wouldn't let me in
            Oh, whoa, whoa
            Oh, God, I...
            Every memory of looking out the back door
            I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
            It's hard to say it, time to say it
            Goodbye, goodbye
            Every memory of walking out the front door
            I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
            It's hard to say it, time to say it
            Goodbye, goodbye
            Goodbye
            Remember the old arcade
            Blew every dollar that we ever made
            The cops hated us hangin' out
            They say, 'Somebody went and burned it down'
            We used to listen to the radio
            And sing along with every song we know
            We said, 'Someday we'd find out how it feels
            To sing to more than just the steering wheel'
            Kim's the first girl I kissed
            I was so nervous that I nearly missed
            She's had a couple of kids since then
            I haven't seen her since God knows when
            Oh, whoa, whoa

            Goodbye, goodbye
            I miss that town, I miss the faces
            You can't erase, you can't replace it
            I miss it now, I can't believe it
            So hard to stay, too hard to leave it
            If I could relive those days
            I know the one thing that would never change
